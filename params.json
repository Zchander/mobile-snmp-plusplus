You can either just download the project and add it as a subproject to your current Xcode project, or you can add this as a submodule to your git repository\r\nIn either case, you should also add the headerfile XISMobileSNMP_PP.h to your project (but do _NOT_ copy it), and you also have to import this header file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
